  ## Description  

  

  A portfolio of web development projects written in the React framework.  

  * Motivation  

    I wanted to have an online collection of my work to point people to for potential employment, to show my firneds and family, and to use React to do it all.  

  * Reason for Building  

    This project serves as my portfolio to showcase my work.  

  * Problems Solved  

    This gives people one centralized place to view both my work, and the code that drives it.  

  * Things Learned  

    I learned how to use the React Router and how to compartmentalize my web app into React Components.
